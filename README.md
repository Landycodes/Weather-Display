# Weather-Display
A weather app that gives you up to date weather information on any location you wish to search! 
to get started open the menu by clicking the icon with the three dashes on the top left corner of the screen. 
then type in the city and the states initial.
once you click the magnifying glass you will see the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast.
the menu will save the locations you look up. however the delete button is a little buggy so it is 
recommended that you refresh the page before deleting an icon to avoid potential bugs for the list.
you can also click on a saved location to pull up the weather info for that place.
here is a link to the [weather-display]()
